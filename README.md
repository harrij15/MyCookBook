//(this is the user/end use documentation, figure out where to put the other types of documentation
**This is the end user documentation.** The guide to acquire the development environment is provided below though.
If you wish to observe the Technical User documentation check [here](https://github.com/harrij15/SquareMeals/blob/master/developers_documentation.md)


SquareMeals is an mobile application that allows users (mainly college students) to compile different easy-to-make and affordable recipes that suit their dietary needs into a cookbook. This app also seeks to create a community where college students on the same campus can share/suggest recipes to others.

## Installation
Thus far, the app is not complete not up on the app store, thus the only way to acquire the app is mostly for developmental purposes.
If you wish to utilize our app, you must access it through the Android Studio emulator or a similar environment.
Please refer to our [Technical User](https://github.com/harrij15/SquareMeals/blob/master/developers_documentation.md) documentation for instructions on how to use these.

## Using the Interface
The Android Studio Emulator appears as such. Soemtimes the app opens automatically but sometimes you must look for it in your apps.
To do so, refer to the image below. Select the boxed, red icon and scroll until you find "SquareMeals"

If you are a new user, click on the [Sign Up] button. You will be met with a standard login screen, which prompts you for your *name*
, a *username*, your *email* and a *password*.

You must have a unique username.

as well as let people select many types of restrictions, primarily allergies foods and similar types.
