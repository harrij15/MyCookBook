## Installation
Thus far, the app is not complete not up on the app store, thus the only way to acquire the app is mostly for developmental purposes.
If you wish to utilize our app, you must access it through the Android Studio emulator or a similar environment.
Please refer to our [Technical User](https://github.com/harrij15/SquareMeals/blob/master/developers_documentation.md) documentation for instructions on how to use these.

## Using the Interface
The Android Studio Emulator appears as such. Soemtimes the app opens automatically but sometimes you must look for it in your apps.
To do so, refer to the image below. Select the boxed, red icon and scroll until you find "SquareMeals"
